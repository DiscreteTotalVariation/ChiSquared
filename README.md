# Zero-disparity Distribution Synthesis: Fast Exact Calculation of Chi-Squared Statistic Distribution for Discrete Uniform Histograms

This is the repository with the source code and experiments that were conducted for the calculation of the exact distribution of the chi-squared statistic for histograms with uniform distribution proposed by [Nikola Banić](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QSH8C_QAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Neven Elezović](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MlXwbFIAAAAJ&hl=en) in the paper [Zero-disparity Distribution Synthesis: Fast Exact Calculation of Chi-Squared Statistic Distribution for Discrete Uniform Histograms](https://arxiv.org/).

## Code

The code is written for Python 3 and it can be used to recreate the main results presented in the paper. It can also be changed to check the behavior in conditions not mentioned in the paper.
